# Renovate Configuration

This repository contains a global Renovate configuration for all repositories defined in the [Renovate Runner](https://github.com/teaall/renovate-runner). The settings are automatically applied during repository onboarding so new repositories will inherit these settings by default. Custom overrides can be added in individual `renovate.json` files as needed.
